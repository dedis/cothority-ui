## Usuage

You need a valid config.toml (see latest [release](https://github.com/dedis/cothority/releases/latest)) or create one by using [run_locally.sh](https://github.com/dedis/cothority/blob/development/app/conode/run_locally.sh) if you are offline.

If you have a valid config you can run the server by
```
go run main.go
```
and visit [http://localhost:9090/start](http://localhost:9090/start) in your browser.
