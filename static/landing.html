    <h3>Cothority: Collective Authority</h3>
    <h4>Securely Decentralising Trust at Scale</h4>

      <p>
        This page provides a simple user interface for the
        <a href="https://github.com/dedis/cothority">prototype of the collective
        authority (cothority)</a> framework.
        The system is based on CoSi, a novel protocol for collective signing which
        itself builds upon Merkle trees and Schnorr multi-signatures over elliptic curves.
        CoSi enables authorities to have their statements collectively signed (co-signed)
        by a diverse, decentralized, and scalable group of (potentially thousands of)
        witnesses and, for example, could be employed to proactively harden critical
        Internet authorities. Among other things, one could imagine applications to the
        Certificate Transparency project, DNSSEC, software distribution, the Tor
        anonymity network or cryptocurrencies.

      <p>TODO: add all necessary info (paper/slides), longterm: we need a logo</p>
      <h4>How can I use it?</h4>
      <p>With this interface you can currently collectively <a href="sign">sign a file</a>
        and (TODO: not yet) <a href="sign">verify the signature</a> (created by this application).
